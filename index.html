            Maybe you're just a simple farmer who has a small giant rat problem. We here at the adventurer's guild have been harded by a life of struggles, 
            and we know that suffering can come in all sizes. That's why there's no job too small, nor too big that we won't take.</p>

                <p>The bulk of our contracts at Adventurer's Guild falls in to this category it turns out. Whether it be a low visibility guard detail,
                    transporting a package securely, or any job that just calls for a specialist we've got you covered. We pride ourselves on sponsoring a wide range of
                    solo operatives to be able to fufill any contract no matter the size!

                <p>For the jobs that need more than one person but an army would be overkill this category is for you. We sponsor a fine selection of locally sourced
                    adventurer groups eager to prove their worth and climb the ranks. Groups range from humble beginners ready to clear vermin off your land to world reknowned hardened 
                    troops who have saved the Earth from doom many times.

                <h2>Large Groups (20+)</h2>
                <p>Groups in these packages are our newest feature! These are all guild backed adventurers that have been chosen based on their speciality and contract history,
                    to band together and train rigorously to act as shock troops. The Orcish Hordes banded together and now siege your kingdom's cities? Does the ancient threat to the north
                    stir once again? These groups will be sure to handle any contract with excellence. As an added bonus, all groups have been trained to work well alongside conventional armies,
                    so they can contracted on their own, or added to your ranks if you want some extra assurance.
